# My first ASP.NET Core Web API 
After completing the related course on Pluralsight, decided to put theory into practice and build my own API by just using my notes. 

Showcasing the use of fundamental tools in the ASP.NET Core framework such as CRUD, dependency injection, MVC pattern, Postman, Content negotiation, Reading/Writing files, Validating input, Data-Annotations, Entity Framework Core, Storing sensitive data, Repository pattern, AutoMapper.
